# Image generation from prevous image by warping the flow calculated from the images using optical flow algorithm HS and LK
This method can be used for image compression where we can optimize the memory issue occurs in storing a large number of images
here I am using the satellite image to calculate the flow  main code is in   <a href="">warp.ipynb</a>
